This is a sample website that was built to gain experience with web development.

Overview
------
This is a social media website that allows the users to post songs from SoundCloud. It is essentially like Twitter, but users are sharing music. It is built with Django, and uses Foundation for the CSS styling. It allows users to create accounts, then post links to songs on SoundCloud. It will then convert the urls to a SoundCloud player, so that everyone can listen to it. As with other social media websites users can follow each other, like posts, and comment on posts. There is also a live chat feature that is built using Django Channels.
